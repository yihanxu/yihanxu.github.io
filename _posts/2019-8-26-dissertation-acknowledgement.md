> Courage is not simply one of the virtues, but the form of every virtue at the testing point.     

> –– C.S. LEWIS


The four-year PhD journey has allowed me to see what courage means in a new light. I was courageous until I attempted this doctoral dissertation, and I would have lost my courage without the encouragement and support from the following people. 

Dr. Charles T. Salmon, my advisor, guided me with unbounded patience, indulged me with interesting ideas and insightful comments, and led (more often nudged) me onto the road toward great scholarship. Dr. Sonny B. Rosenthal, my co-advisor, offered me meticulous guidance on experimental design and implementation, inspiring me to try new methods and saving me from potentially disastrous dead ends. Dr. Christopher Cummings, my co-advisor, gave me detailed guidance on concept explication, piquing many bubbles of my vagueness. 

My thesis advisory committee and confirmation panel (Dr. Georgios Christopoulos, Dr. May O. Lwin, Dr. John C. Besley, and Dr. Kim H. Kyung) gave me critical and constructive suggestions. 

Dr. Xavier Basagaña gave me hands-on supervision during my Master and made research seem easy. Dr. Hwang C. Yang, Dr. Barbara Fasolo, and Dr. Valentina Ferretti sharpened my understanding of behavioral economics. Dr. George J. Augustine introduced me to the world of neuroscience. Dr. Kwan Min Lee showed me the way to grant applications and let me taste the joy of success. Dr. Brendan Luyt demonstrated to me what an academic free spirit looks like. Dr. Joseph B. Walther “tortured” me with philosophy of research, but I survived and appreciated his tough love.

My peers (Jolie, Cui Min, Yan Wah, Sang Sang, Lichen, Guo Qing, Guangyuan, Yanru, Kate, Emma, Ysa, Jeremy, Xiaoyu, and Zijian) shared with me many eureka moments and walked with me through some dark valleys.       
       
My friends (Zhiting, Gengzhou, Fangfang, Joy, Yifan, Isaac, Yage, Zhenyan, Wanlu, Maggie, Linsheng, Shayne, Hayek, Lijing, Grace, and Naisi) cheered me up and prayed for me when I was down and clapped for me when I made progress.

Shireen, Tin Yan, Li chia, Yanti, and Joanne cleared administrative barriers for me.

NTU and WKWSCI offered me scholarship that spared me of financial concerns.

My parents Meizhen Huang and Lianxin Xu love and support me unconditionally.

My love and luck of life – Leyi Zhang – is proud of me despite all my faults and weakness. 

You will always have my gratitude.
