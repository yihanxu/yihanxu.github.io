When Claudia Goldin won the Nobel Prize for [uncovering drivers of gender differences in the labour market](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2023/press-release/) last October, I was just about to start my second trimester.

Seeing the trajectory of women’s career since 1790 makes me feel lucky as I was born in the era where women not only can work, but can get high-quality jobs. Yet I gave very little thought about the potential impact of becoming a parent, or more precisely, a mother. Because I had an uneventful first trimester — no morning sickness, little fatigue, the bump wasn’t obvious — life felt normal to me.

(forgive me but I’m gonna omit the birth story and the first few months postpartum, that’s too long a story for today’s snapshot!)

Now as I’m approaching the end of maternity leave and starting a new job next week, I remembered about the nice graph that showed where the gender pay gap came from. I found myself downgraded to the ground floor exactly as depicted in the cartoon (thanks to the maternity pay discount), and I need to build stairs to get out of the pit.

The prospect doesn’t seem promising. I was warned about the motherhood penalty by a recent research by the King’s Fund. I was also reminded by the Economist How motherhood hurts career. And my observations of the peers have largely confirmed the findings.

I’m not sure what awaits me. I don’t know to which extent the average statistics will apply to me. But it won’t be long before I find out the answer, and this time, I will be the partipant for my own case study.

I look forward to sharing with you preliminary findings after 90 days. Stay tuned!
