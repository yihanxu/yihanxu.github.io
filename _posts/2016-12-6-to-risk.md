### 冒险

作者：威廉·亚瑟·沃德

若开怀大笑，就得冒被当成傻子的风险，
若泪湿衣襟，就得冒被认为多愁善感的风险。
若帮助别人，就得冒被牵连的风险，
若真情流露，就得冒被人看穿的风险。
若在众人面前言明自己的想法与梦想，就得冒失去它们的风险。

爱人，就得冒单相思的风险，
活着，就得冒将死去的风险，
寄希望，就得冒失望的风险，
去尝试，就得冒失败的风险。

但这些风险，我们必须直面。因为不冒任何风险，才是生命中最大的风险。
不敢冒险的人，将一事无成、一无所有、一无是处。
他兴许能避免苦难与悲痛，
但他无法学习、无法感受、无法改变、无法成长，也无法生活。
他将处处屈从，放弃选择的自由，最终沦为奴隶。
只有敢于冒险，人才自由。

悲观者抱怨海风不利；
乐观者期望海风转向；
只有务实者调整风帆。

今天路过某搞风险传播的教授的办公室，读到他门口贴的这首小诗，顿觉颇有共鸣，便随手翻译于此。与大家共勉。

附原文如下
### To risk 
by William Arthur Ward

To laugh is to risk appearing a fool,
To weep is to risk appearing sentimental.
To reach out to another is to risk involvement,
To expose feelings is to risk exposing your true self.
To place your ideas and dreams before a crowd is to risk their loss.

To love is to risk not being loved in return,
To live is to risk dying,
To hope is to risk despair,
To try is to risk failure.

But risks must be taken because the greatest hazard in life is to risk nothing.
The person who risks nothing, does nothing, has nothing, is nothing.
He may avoid suffering and sorrow,
But he cannot learn, feel, change, grow or live.
Chained by his servitude he is a slave who has forfeited all freedom.
Only a person who risks is free.

The pessimist complains about the wind;
The optimist expects it to change;
And the realist adjusts the sails.
